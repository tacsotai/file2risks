# file2risks

## 1. Project Overview
**file2risks** is an open-source module designed to analyze browser history (and other digital traces) to detect **potential risks** and uncover **opportunities** for safer digital habits.  
It is part of the larger [RiskAware](https://www.sotai.co/) project, which empowers families and individuals to use technology more safely and effectively.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Early stage**: Results are still in development, and predictions may not yet be fully accurate. Your contributions can help improve this tool for everyone!  

---

## 2. Motivation & Vision
- Parents and individuals often face the challenge of balancing **freedom and safety** in the digital world.  
- Existing tools focus heavily on **blocking or monitoring**, which can feel restrictive.  
- We believe in a more empowering approach: **awareness and informed decision-making**.  
- By making this project **open source**, we invite a global community to collaborate, innovate, and refine the system together.

## 3. Current Status
- Core pipeline: **BERT + AutoEncoder + SHAP** anomaly detection.  
- Outputs JSON with detected ‚Äúrisk candidates‚Äù and potential insights.  
- Known limitations:  
  - Low precision/recall due to limited training data.  
  - Small dataset (tested with minimal browser history samples).  
  - User experience is still developer-focused and not yet optimized for general users.

## 4. How It Works

1. **Upload Your Data**  
   Provide your browser history or other digital traces to the system.  
2. **Analysis in Progress**  
   The system processes your data using advanced AI models.  
3. **Receive Notifications**  
   Once the analysis is complete, you‚Äôll be notified and can review the results, including potential risks and actionable insights.
