# file2risks

## 1. Project Overview
**file2risks** is an open-source module that analyzes browser history (and other digital traces) to detect **potential risks**.  
It is part of the larger [RiskAware](https://www.sotai.co/) project, which aims to help families use technology more safely.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Early stage**: results are still rough and predictions are far from perfect. This is exactly why contributions matter!  

---

## 2. Motivation & Vision
- Parents (especially developers with kids) know the tension between **freedom and safety** in the digital world.  
- Existing parental control tools are often about **blocking and surveillance**.  
- We believe in a different approach: **awareness and dialogue**.  
- This project is built as **open source**, so anyone can join, experiment, and improve it together.  

---

## 3. Current Status
- Core pipeline: **BERT + AutoEncoder + SHAP** anomaly detection.  
- Outputs JSON with detected ‚Äúrisk candidates.‚Äù  
- Known limitations:  
  - Low precision/recall  
  - Limited dataset (tested with small browser history samples)  
  - UX not ready for non-developers

## 5. How to Contribute
- **Developers** ‚Üí improve anomaly detection, experiment with models (PyOD, PyCaret, transformers, etc.)  
- **Designers / UX** ‚Üí propose how insights should be visualized for parents/kids  
- **Parents / Users** ‚Üí share scenarios, feedback, or small datasets (if comfortable)  

üëâ Contributions of any size are welcome: fixing typos, raising issues, writing docs, or submitting PRs.

## 6. Roadmap
- [ ] Better README (with diagrams, examples)  
- [ ] Support more data sources (chat history, messaging logs)  
- [ ] Compare anomaly detection methods beyond BERT-AE  
- [ ] Integrate with [RiskAware App](https://riskaware.sotai.co)
- [ ] Build a small community (Discord/Slack)
